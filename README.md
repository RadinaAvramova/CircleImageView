CircleImageView
===============

A fast circular ImageView perfect for profile images. This is based on [RoundedImageView from Vince Mi](https://github.com/vinc3m1/RoundedImageView) which itself is based on techniques recommended by [Romain Guy](https://twitter.com/romainguy).

![CircleImageView](https://raw.github.com/hdodenhof/CircleImageView/master/screenshot.png)

It uses a BitmapShader and **does not**:
* create a copy of the original bitmap
* use a clipPath (which is neither hardware accelerated nor anti-aliased)
* use setXfermode to clip the bitmap (which means drawing twice to the canvas)

As this is just a custom ImageView and not a custom Drawable or a combination of both, it can be used with all kinds of drawables, i.e. a PicassoDrawable from [Picasso](https://github.com/square/picasso) or other non-standard drawables (needs some testing though).

Gradle
------
```
dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'de.hdodenhof:circleimageview:3.1.0'
}
```

Usage
-----
```xml
<de.hdodenhof.circleimageview.CircleImageView
    xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    android:id="@+id/profile_image"
    android:layout_width="96dp"
    android:layout_height="96dp"
    android:src="@drawable/profile"
    app:civ_border_width="2dp"
    app:civ_border_color="#FF000000"/>
```

Limitations
-----------
* The ScaleType is always CENTER_CROP and you'll get an exception if you try to change it. This is (currently) by design as it's perfectly fine for profile images.
* Enabling `adjustViewBounds` is not supported as this requires an unsupported ScaleType
* If you use an image loading library like Picasso or Glide, you need to disable their fade animations to avoid messed up images. For Picasso use the `noFade()` option, for Glide use `dontAnimate()`. If you want to keep the fadeIn animation, you have to fetch the image into a `Target` and apply a custom animation yourself when receiving the `Bitmap`.
* Using a `TransitionDrawable` with `CircleImageView` doesn't work properly and leads to messed up images.
